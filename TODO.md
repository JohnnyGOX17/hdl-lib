| [FIR_type_I.vhd](./DSP/filters/FIR/hdl/FIR_type_I.vhd#L78) | 78 |  is this the right order to feed data to match coefs? |
| [sample_covar_matrix.vhd](./DSP/linear_algebra/sample_covar_matrix/hdl/sample_covar_matrix.vhd#L48) | 48 |  double-buffered covar matrix reg's so one can be read out while another is calculated with inputs? |
| [boundary_cell.vhd](./DSP/linear_algebra/QR/hdl/boundary_cell.vhd#L113) | 113 |  need only care about input vectoring timing?? |
| [run.py](./run.py#L10) | 10 |  Eventually use blob pattern to include all? -> lib.add_source_files("./vhdl/*/*.vhd") |
